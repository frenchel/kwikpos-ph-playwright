# KwikPOS PH â€“ Web Test Automation with Playwright

This project is a web test automation suite for KwikPOS PH (https://www.kwikpos.ph), built using Playwright.  

## Project Features

### Automated Form Validation
- Validates form fields across pages like:
  - Homepage
  - All product pages: KwikPOS Mobile, Tablet, Tablet All-in-One, Single Screen, Dual Screen, Self-Ordering Kiosk
- Fields tested (positive and negative testing):
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Phone Number
  - Company Name
  - Region/City dropdowns

### Reusable Test Functions
- Modular helpers in `utils/form-helper.ts`:
  - `fillForm()` â€“ simulate valid user input
  - `validateForm()` â€“ simulate validation errors
- Enables DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding across test cases.

### Chat Widget Automation
- Handles **Tawk.to** chat widget within nested iframes.
- Automates:
  - New conversation trigger
  - Filling required fields (Name, Email, Phone, Company)
  - Submission validation
- Verifies if field validations trigger on incorrect input.

### ðŸ“„ Custom Reporter
- Custom terminal reporter logs:
  - Success cases
  - Failures with detailed context (e.g., missing field validation)
- Located in `reporters/custom-reporter.ts`.

### ðŸ§­ UI Navigation Tests
- Verifies correct routing for:
  - Header links
  - Navbar dropdowns
  - Footer links
- Uses consistent `page.locator()` strategies with assertions.

### ðŸŽ¥ Video Recording (Optional)
- Playwright supports recording videos of test sessions.
- Great for demo videos on LinkedIn or presentations.
