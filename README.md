## Disclaimer
After interning at OneClickTech, where I performed manual QA testing for the KwikPOS PH website (developed by the company), I created this personal test automation project to further enhance my QA skills. While I worked on the website as a manual QA intern, this automation project was developed independently for learning and portfolio purposes. It is not officially affiliated with OneClickTech or KwikPOS PH.
